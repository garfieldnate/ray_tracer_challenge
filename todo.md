# TODO

* Canvas write_pixel: fail properly for out of bounds
* Clean up canvas and color and post them on code review.se
* Projectile seems surprisingly slow. Are we copying data when we shouldn't?


### Maybes/Ideas

* Better model of point vs. vector: typing should reflect difference
* Reorganize as [workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-workspace-section)
* reimplement everything using geometric algebra for funsies
