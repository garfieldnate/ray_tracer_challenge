# Ray Tracer Challenge in Rust

This is a personal project. I'm learning Rust while working my way through Jamis Buck's [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/). The book is extremely addictive and this has been one of the funnest projects I've ever worked on!

## Important Commands

* `cargo test`
* `cargo run --bin soft_shadows > soft_shadows.ppm` (replace with other demo binary name as needed)
* Display PPM file with `open xyz.ppm` (on Mac)

## Example Images

I've been uploading them to a GitHub issue (a bit old school of me, yes ;)): https://github.com/garfieldnate/ray_tracer_challenge/issues/1
